'If serving with grains, prepare at this time (follow links above for instructions). In the meantime, if preparing chickpeas, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). Rinse and drain chickpeas well. Then pat very dry — this will help them crisp up. To a medium mixing bowl add oil, miso paste, maple syrup, and chili garlic sauce or red pepper flake and whisk to combine. Then add chickpeas and toss to coat. Arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet (or more baking sheets as needed if increasing batch size) and bake for 20-25 minutes, tossing/stirring once at the halfway point to ensure even baking. They''re done when crisp and deep golden brown (see photo). Set aside. Next prepare dressing by adding chili garlic paste or red pepper flake, maple syrup, coconut aminos or tamari, lime juice, vinegar, sesame oil, and garlic (optional) to a small mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime or vinegar for acidity, salt or coconut aminos or tamari for saltiness, maple syrup for sweetness, or chili garlic sauce or red pepper flake for added heat. You want this to be quite flavorful so don’t be shy! Prepare any vegetable garnishes / toppings at this time and set aside.

'2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, 1 tsp sea salt, 12 Tbsp cold vegan butter, 1 3/4 sticks yields 12 Tbsp or 168 g), 4-6 Tbsp ice cold water, 3 cups fresh or frozen blueberries, 1 Tbsp organic cane sugar (plus more for topping), 1 tsp cornstarch',
'Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and position a rack in the middle of the oven. Also get out two large baking sheets. In a large mixing bowl, mix the flour and salt. Cut butter into the flour until well blended using a pastry cutter or fork. Add chilled water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time and stir until the dough scrapes away from the bowl. This will depend on the flour you use, but usually requires around 4-5 Tbsp. If you add too much water, add more flour to compensate. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Without overworking, form into a ball, then divide into four segments if making small galettes, or six segments if making mini galettes. Working one at a time and adding more flour as needed, use a floured rolling pin to roll each piece of dough out into a rough circle. Use the rolling pin to carefully transfer to the baking sheets (you will need two depending on their size) by placing the rolling pin at one end of the dough and gently folding the dough over the rolling pin. Then lift, transfer, and fold the dough off of the rolling pin onto the baking sheet. Add blueberries to the dough bowl — no need to rinse it — and toss with sugar and cornstarch. Divide berries evenly among the pies, placing in the center of the dough. Next, carefully fold the crust edges up, overlapping them as you go. Try to ensure no cracks remain or the fruit will seep out during baking. Brush pies with a touch of water (or melted vegan butter) and sprinkle with organic cane or raw sugar to ensure a golden, crisp crust. Bake for 20-28 minutes for mini galettes or 28-35 minutes for small galettes, or until the crust is golden brown and the fruit is bubbly. Serve warm with a scoop of vegan ice cream or coconut whipped cream.',
